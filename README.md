 App that allwows user to use phone as an input device for computers.


Basic functionalities:

The phone has a accelerometer, if we integrate that we can get the velocity. We only need to use x and y axis for the velocity.
Also another detail is that since the acceleromter may not be so accurate, we can also set the velocity to 0 when the acceleration is 0.

This should give a fairly accurate velocity of the cursor.

I need to hook my phone as a bluetooth input device so that it can input cursor movement to the computer.

The left and right click should be quite easy to implement, but the scroll wheel may be needed to replace by a d-pad.


Advanced functionalities:

macros for key binding if a user wants to use this app to play games, the macros can also be moved around the screen, and can even try macro the volume and power button.
saving of macros to some google account
multiple macro features

save macros to cloud

give user vibration feedback when pressing keys to ensure no mispress
